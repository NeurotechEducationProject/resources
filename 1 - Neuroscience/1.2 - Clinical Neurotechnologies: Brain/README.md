## Epilepsy

Epilepsy is a devastating disease that affects approximately 1% of the population, or about 3.4 million people in the US.

In the majority of patients (70-85%), epilepsy can be controlled with medication. However, the remaining 15-30% of patients with medically intractable epilepsy can suffer significant morbidity or even death due to uncontrolled seizures.

For these patients, surgical removal of the source of the seizures provides the best chance of a cure or long-term seizure control.

### Epilepsy Surgery

- **Diagnosis**
  - **Subdural Electrodes (ECoG)** on the surface of the brain
  - **Depth Electrodes (EEG)** in the brain
- **Treatment**
  - **Resection** - Temporal Lobectomy
  - **Ablation** - Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)
  - **Neuromodulation** - VNS, RNS, DBS

#### Diagnosis

To treat epilepsy surgically, the source of the seizures must be localized. This process requires recording and analyzing brain activity with either subdural electrodes or depth electrodes.

**Subdural electrodes** are placed on the surface of the brain, but they require an open craniotomy. This means that a portion of the skull is temporarily removed.

**Depth electrodes** are placed inside the brain and can record electrical activity from deeper structures with less noise. Small holes are drilled in the skull and, during surgery, MRI scans are used to guide the placement of the electrodes.

#### Treatment

After the source of the seizures is localized, patients may undergo one of the following surgical procedures:

**Resection** is the most common surgical procedure for epilepsy. During a resection, the surgeon removes the area of the brain that is causing the seizures.

**Ablation** is a newer technique that uses a laser to destroy the area of the brain that is causing the seizures. This technique is less invasive than resection and can be performed with a smaller incision.

**Neuromodulation** is a technique that uses electrical stimulation to control seizures. There are several types of neuromodulation devices, including the Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS), the Responsive Neurostimulator (RNS), and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).

## Movement Disorders

There are many dissorders that affect movement, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.

Some of the common symptoms of Parkinson's disease include:

- Stiffness (cogwheel rigidity)
- Slowness of movement (bradykinesia)
- Resting tremor

However, Parkinson's disease is ***not*** just a movement disorder. Other symptoms include:

- Depression - up to 80% of patients
- Anxiety
- Loss of smell
- Constipation
- Insomnia
- Incontinence
- Low blood pressure
- Memory problems and dementia

Usually, medications can control early symptoms, but as Parkinson's progresses, they become less effective. In order to avoid the side effects of higher doeses of medication, some patients may consider Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).

### DBS Surgery

To treat Parkinson's disease with DBS, two types of surgeries can be performed:

- **Awake DBS** - the traditional method
- **Asleep DBS** - a newer MRI-guided surgery

Performing the operation while the patient is **awake** allows the surgeon to test the effectiveness of the stimulation in real-time. However, this method can be uncomfortable for the patient.

The **asleep** method uses MRI to guide the placement of the electrodes while the patient is under general anesthesia. The entire surgery is performed inside the MRI magnet with real-time imaging of the brain, the lead, and the target.

The latter method is ideal for:

- Severe anxiety
- Severe tremor
- Unable to hold medications overnight
- Concerns of speaking during surgery
- Dystonia with severe contractions

Both surgeries have equivalent outcomes, infection rates, and complications. It is up to the patient to decide which method is best for them.

## Research

Ongoing research is focused on improving the understanding of human neurophysiology, epilepsy networks, and the basal gangliaâ€™s role in movement disorders. In another lesson we will discuss the use of **Closed-Loop Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)** to control robotic limbs and get artificial sensory feedback.
