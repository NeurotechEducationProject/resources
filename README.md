# Neurotech Education Project

Welcome to the **Neurotech Education Project**! This repository is an open-source collection of educational resources focusing on the applications of **Artificial Intelligence** in **Neuroscience**. Explore tutorials, presentations, hands-on projects, and discussions designed to provide a solid, high-level understanding of these fields and of the latest research that is being conducted. While this project is primarily targeted at high school students, all learners are welcome.

# ✨ Who We Are

We are a group of high school students from Pierce - The American College of Greece. We are deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience, and we are excited to share all the knowledge we have gained with our community.

# 🎯 Why We Created This

During the summer of 2024, we participated in the **Youth Neurotech Education Workshop** at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu). This workshop was a transformative experience that introduced us to the field of Neuroscience and its intersection with Artificial Intelligence. We wanted to create this repository to share our knowledge with others and to inspire our peers to explore these extremely interesting fields.

# 🧠 Learning Objectives

After following the lessons in this repository, you should be able to:

- Express in your own words key concepts in Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence.
- Understand the importance of AI in Neuroscience.
- Train and evaluate a simple Neural Network.
- Consider the ethical dilemmas that arise in these fields.

***Above all, you should be excited to learn more about the way technology can be applied to save and improve lives.***
